                            <strong>The 4 C’s of Mental Toughness:</strong>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Control</strong> This is the extent to which you feel you are in control of your life, including your emotions and sense of life purpose. The control component can be considered your self-esteem. To be high on the Control scale means to feel comfortable in your own skin and have a good sense of who you are.</li>
<li><strong>Commitment</strong> This is the extent of your personal focus and reliability. To be high on the Commitment scale is to be able to effectively set goals and consistently achieve them, without getting distracted. A high Commitment level indicates that you’re good at establishing routines and habits that cultivate success.</li>
<li><strong>Challenge</strong> This is the extent to which you are driven and adaptable. To be high on the Challenge scale means that you are driven to achieve your personal best, and you see challenges, change, and adversity as opportunities rather than threats; you are likely to be flexible and agile. To be low on the Challenge scale means that you might see change as a threat, and avoid novel or challenging situations out of fear of failure.</li>                           
<li><strong>Confidence</strong> This is the extent to which you believe in your ability to be productive and capable; it is your self-belief and the belief that you can influence others. To be high on the Confidence scale is to believe that you will successfully complete tasks, and to take setbacks in stride while maintaining routine and even strengthening your resolve.</li>

                                    Reacting with anger or frustration might escalate the situation further.</li>
                                    <li><strong>Educate Yourself:</strong> Learn more about different forms of microaggressions and the impact they can have.
